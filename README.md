Project management with that great wobbly taste.

-models for users, boards, lists, cards
-start creating api routes for post/put/get/delete for boards, lists, and cards WITH TESTS
-make sure you have model that allows for users to be connected to boards by being added as a card member < ONLY PLACE WHERE MEMBERS ARE CONNECTED, SO TO SPEAK
/api/users/:user/board < post method for adding to user's boards array
